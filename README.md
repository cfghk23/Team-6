## Problem Statement

1. Users (Students)

- a solution that incorporates effective educational methods, gamification elements, and intuitive design.

- Animated character
- Color schemes

2. Teachers & Admins

- Data visualization for analyzing better user engagement patterns
- Better structured impact assessment report. [Sent every month]

- for every project -> IOT

## Questions

1. Who decides who has access to what course?

- teacher can choose what model can go form
- pick certain ones
- self-directed learning
- design thinking

- Issue: not enough class time, not enough experience
- Self-navigation, self-directed, students can learn by themselves
- Teacher lesson plan

2. Can we use IOT?
3. Can a course use different party resources?
   - Kahoot, is it ok to direct them?
4. What metrics do we need to take account for?

[StoryLine360: What answer correct/wrong]

- Time
- has to be divided by course name

5. Visualize the data (teachers)
6. Leaderboard
7. Should there be different design for different user groups?
8. In-person event: newsboard

- different design

9. Peer engagement -> do online

## Answers

1. Projects: Business Plan competition, budgeting

## Branching

1. Split frontend and backend to different branches
2. Commit to respective branches
3. Merge to main

## Useful git commands:

- Create new branch and switch:

```
- git checkout -b feature-branch
```

- Switch to branch:

```
- git checkout feature-branch
```
